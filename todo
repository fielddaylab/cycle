X- Announcer more expressive
X- Tutorial
- New Assets (?)
X- End Game
X- figure out 3rd turn popup
X- keep spinning? (random pos- not convinced blatant enough)

mockup notes

X- What does intro screen look like (choose gametype, etc...)
X- Who's turn is it? - in game conversation
- What happens when player 2 plays (fill in details between "I've played my card" to "It is again my turn")? (whether it be internet player, AI, or local) - in game conversation
X- What happens when the game is over?
- Does it show how many turns left before goal shifts?
- The "(TokenImg) X3" things might look like it's counting # tokens you have on the board (which is actually constant)
X- Is there to be any indicator of how many tokens owned by each player exist on each space? (Can get crowded)
X- Given that the cards have less info as the game goes on- what does that look like? (Question marks in place of icons?)
- What does it look like when waiting for other player's turn? - in game conversation
- What turn # is it? 
X(Ignore)- How long until "layer of information" removed (ie "lose icons in 2 turns" or "at turn #3")?
- How long until "end of game"?
X- What should I be doing right now? (previously, a prompt at top of screen saying ie- "Choose an Event Card") - in game conversation
X- What is the top black bar for? (What happens when you click the triple-bar menu icon thing?) - nav bar. should be outside of canvas element
X- Where do the cards hover in relation to the non-hovering card (difference btwn selecting top card and bottom card... goes offscreen?)
- Who am I? (in the case of networked) - in game conversation

needs

X- icons to go on cards - waiting on illustrations from artist.
X- main map/node assets
X- corresponding 'node selected' assets to go with new assets
X- blue arrow asset (arrow@2x in zip) has drop shadow; assets that will be rotated can't have drop shadow baked in. (also, if an asset is going to be rotated, it's easiest for me if the asset is pointing to the right (cos(0),sin(0)) )
- any gradients used (can be 1px wide if gradient is vertical, 1px tall if horizontal, etc...)
X- fonts (all fonts are open sans)
